## How to use ðŸŽ® 

It adds a new category on Slimefun Guide (/sf guide) which contains the objects added by the plugin. At this moment only the Nuclear warheads are available, as the option to add them through configuration files. When a nuke explodes it creates a spherical crater with the specified radius, along with the explosion.
